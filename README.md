# <span style="color:orange"> Rust Hangman </span> #

**Name:** Hangman  
**Version:** 0.2

This is a simple terminal-based hangman program made using the Rust programming language as a means to learn the basic functionalities of the language.   

I plan to latter fix up and improve performance of the code with further knowledge and experience I get from using Rust more.
